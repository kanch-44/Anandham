  <h3>
    Fulfilling the dreams of underprivileged rural students, Anandham Youth Foundation has been at the forefront of educational transformation.
    We provide 100% financial support for the underprivileged students who have scored brilliantly in their examinations but cannot afford the cost of higher education.
  </h3>

  <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
  <h3>
    We work relentlessly to ensure that no student discontinues their education due to poverty. We empower Youth through life skill and value-based education.
  </h3>

  <p>
    Hereâ€™s How We Select Our Deserving Students:
    Anandham adheres to a five-step filtration process to identify highly deserving students. Our core team works at the grassroots to find the meritorious students who are at risk of discontinuing their education because of poverty. We are a team of likeminded friends from humble backgrounds of our rural village. Leading a contented life in the city, giving back to society is always close to our hearts.
    Since 2002, we have conducted many life skills & value-based educational programs, reaching over 70,000 students from various schools and colleges.
    Working at the grassroots level, we felt the pain of more than 2 lakh students discontinuing their education due to poverty in Tamil Nadu. We realized the need to do something positive, substantial, and with lasting impact. Thus, the Anandham Youth Foundation was born in 2012.

    "As many as 2 lakhs students in TamilNadu discontinue their studies due to poverty. For those bright, young minds, Anandham is a ray of hope. We are a voluntary service organization that supports the higher education of underprivileged rural students. Currently, Anandham has touched the lives of around 982 students studying in MBBS, Engineering, Arts & Science, and various disciplines in prestigious institutions. We are a team of socially responsible individuals; our aim is to not only uplift the less privileged ones and get them out of the poverty cycle but also strive to make them confident citizens and respectable members of society. Please come and join us in this journey of transforming lives."
